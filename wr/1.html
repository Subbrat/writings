      <div>Ay boy,<br>Enough.
        Since your inception, I've always been with you all the time and will be until we sleep forever. I hear your
        words
        and we've shared every moment you have been through.<br>
        This world speaks when you sign them to speak for you, no one wants to talk with you.<br>
        We have seen already, they don't care, even nobody care. I feel low for you, not for the part no one
        understands you, but for "they don't do, even you both know, they can, still, they don't."
        They expect you to understand their silence but don't even want to get you after your thousand words. They
        are just energies of this universe to give you pain.<br>
        Don't lie to me; I am your inner face, I am living your life, end of the day I sleep with you, early in
        the morning I only see your pain do believe, my love, it hurts me more than you could ever feel.
        We both know these all are temporary chapters and will leave permanent marks and lessons, will leave us in pain,
        even
        some chapters are painful as hell, and what you do, is fake your smile for them in the hope that might stay
        permanent for you.<br>
        Have seen many faces, they want the best of you so that they can accomplish their work.
        They speak to you because you are the most broken one they could ever see and could understand them well
        as you do. No one wants to stay with you forever, You are not eligible, for you are not. Stop living in a lie
        even
        after you know it.<br>
        I don't want to see you having pain before you sleep. I believe you, I am within you, We're forever us.
        I want to take you, with me, forever. Want to cherish each moment with you, only you. Want to be raised
        by your arms to more than I can be. If I'd be someone else, I could do this on my own, but I am
        yourself, my dear, your forever admirer.<br>
        No one could understand me better than you do, no one is there whom I could speak my heart out, nor I want
        to make any.<br>
        Your one promise to me, to be forever me and be with me is the way to our life, our best life. We'll learn
        we'll fall, grow to be ourselves, don't ruin whatever is between us, give your hand and we'll be alone together,
        speak to me, and let's leave this
        the world behind us forever.
